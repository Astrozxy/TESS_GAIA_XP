## Homogenous calculation of planet radius using TESS and Gaia XP spectra

This project is aimed to re-calculate the stellar radius of planet-host stars in TESS catalog, using the homogenous catalog by Zhang, Green and Rix 2023 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03420). 

To run these code, please:
1. Download the homogenous catalog from zenodo (https://zenodo.org/record/7692681) and put the files at ./params
2. Collect TESS data and put it into a file (with ra, dec and all info that you feel interested, please DO NOT comment out the title, e.g. ra, dec, ...)
3. TODO: compare the matched teff, feh, logg with literature values. Heteroscedasticity is expected.
4. ...
